Aloha, before all, i am very thankfull to any & every one who in||&&directly helped to make this pile of nights come to life
friends, stackoverflowers, codepeners <3
to anyone who really wants to find you, google, search, read.
We all developers know how to google, and that is the truth.
As I started rewriting the code, I started commenting more, and
also including references to where I got the code from.
Better habbits, & a better being I guess.
Of course, I might've forgot some times, so please do excuse me || #sueAnotherStartUp .
and...
signing just a bit after 4:20,

  <p>
    Now with a serious, corporative, language.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kollaj is the work of Kristian Krasimirov Atanasov. Put together with some artistic mind, lots of stacks overflowing, clearly - I had code, I had a pen, BAM! I had the help of codepen. Cofee@420, and <i>a little help from my friends</i>. I shall name them, in no order of relevance: <br/> -Beatriz França, <br/> -João Monteiro,<br/> -João Silva,<br/> -Carlos Silva,<br/> -Filipe Nunes,<br/> -Pedro Ferreira, ''''</p>

  <p>
    I probably would like the following bolded out. <br/>
    <b> I am not a programmer. I am an artist, a self made man. </b>
    This work is nothing more than a proof of concept service TRYING to stay alive. A startup. And a little buggy, slow app. but <br/>
    <b>DON'T PANIC,<br/>
    WE WILL MAKE IT BETTER, JUST KEEP USING IT!<br/> </b>
    I made Kollaj with the intention to wake a more artistically oriented mindset breaking nowadays's ''in the box'' streamlined fashion of content sharing.
   <br/>
    That is, all content we shared untill now was made to fit a certain layout, order. Not only in design terms, but also as a piece.<i> Kollaj aims to break this rule</i>, it is a tool that allows you, and everyone, to gather the important pieces, and conjugate them into something unique. Be it to make a piece of art, to share how your day or vacations followed, or keep a kollaj with the latest news. <br/>
    Allowing you to cut photos (and later on videos), is a way to make your feed personal, and pleasant. The geometric patterns you will use in your Kollaj will form an unique and natural feel of your feed.<br/> <br/>And YES! Cutting is really easy, the Editor, Ed for short is about a couple of months worth of work, and he came from Coffeelandia. Ed is the core of Kollaj. He had various shapes, and forms, but he finally materialized in the island of stability.<br/>
    Both in terms of feel, and being stable enough to release. <br/>
    His final accounted shape can be found in the source code of Kollaj and the base model @ my Codepen account on codepen.io/spacewalkingninja. <br/>
    Ed works with snapsvg under the hood, and allows you to make two consecutive cuts to the photo. Not more, not less.<br/> The side of the photo that gets deleted is the smaller, NOT containing the center point.. yeah that's why it appears when you cut. <br/>
    This is about the point where I mention <i> Ed's worst nightmare</i>. New Phones on Kollaj. <br/>
    Not that he has some kind of problem with them or something, it's just that as the feed os the user expands, I think this is HIGHLY LIKELY to be due to either CSS Pixels, to Pixels, and about I don't know what other kinds of conversion and <i>voodoo</i>, values get distorted to about 0.01-0.09 % over a greater distance from the start when saving the photo. Like when saving a photo at 6 000 pixels from the start, this picture might get saved @what is visually 6090px.<br/>This is why there is the calibration tool at your disposal, when things start going wrong. Usually the blunt test tells you how well your phone is calibrated. (Cut a blunt, and save it over the mouth of someone on a picture far down your Kollaj, if the blunt stays where you put it, EVERYTHING IS FINE! If not satisfied, calibrate, higher calibration means photos will appear HIGHER on your Kollaj.) <br/>
    This is one of my most prioritized bugs to be resolved. Any ideas are appreaciated and in the meantime, as soon as I have time to really fix this, I shall :) ! <br/>

    Kollaj is not based about likes or dislikes, Kollaj is all about vibes. Your photo can be somewhere high or low on the rainbow. The meaning, if such exists, you attribute on your own.<br/>
    Only you are allowed to see the medium color of your photos. You can't see other users' photos color, or <i>vice-versa</i>.
  </p>
  <p> Clearly, I hope you enjoy Kollaj, even as it is today. In the short to long term, I hope we can make Kollaj a better service, improving not only speeds and user experience, but adding relevant new features as the user base grows, and we see what else can we innovate.
